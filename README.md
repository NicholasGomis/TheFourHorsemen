# Help! I need a Holiday

This is a very simple React app that helps you pick a holiday destination by showing you facts about a random country when you press the button to 'find my next holiday destination.

## What does the app do?

The app retrieves countries from a RESTful Country API and diplays the information on the page. The country selected is chosen by a simple random number generator. The data is refreshed every time the button is pressed.

## Contributors

This repo was created as part of a Hackathon Friday, where the aim was to create an app in five hours, including design and presentation. There were four team members - Cintia, Israel, Nicholas and Sinead.
